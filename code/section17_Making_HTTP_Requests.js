//example of XML data structure 

//XML can represent any form of information. 
//XML is just a wide ranging way of transmitting data. 
//XML is not very common anymore. 
<name>
    <first>John</first>
    <last>Anderson</last>
</name>
<email>Todd@gmail.com</email>
//In javascript, we have a way of taking this data,
//and turning it into a javascript object. It would look like the following.

{
    name: {
        first: 'John',
        last: 'Anderson'
    },
    email: 'Todd@gmail.com'
}
