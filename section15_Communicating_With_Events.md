### Intro to DOM Events 

This is where we start to make cool applications that do things! Events allow us to run our code to create an element, remove an element, or change a colour when a specific interaction happens from a user. There are tons and tons of different events out there. Here is a small sample of some of the more common event handlers that we will use.

If we go to MDN web docs, we can go through the event handlers in JS within the doc, these are grouped together.
