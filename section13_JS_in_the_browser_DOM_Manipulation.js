INTRODUCTION TO THE DOM

This is where JS becomes more visual and we can make stuff that we can actually see! 
There is a lot to cover in terms of the DOM! 

Javascript helps to give our webpages an interactive element! 

Javascript in a way gives our websites a life! and can help to make our pages interactive and more user friendly! 

Javascript can be used to put logic into our applications. 

All the interactivity on our websites can be achieved through the use of Javascript.

Javascript and the DOM in very exciting stuff. 

This is where we start to take HTML and CSS and play with it using javascript.
