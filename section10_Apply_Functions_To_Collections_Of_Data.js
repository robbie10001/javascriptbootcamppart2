INTRODUCTION TO ARRAY CALLBACK METHODS

In this section we are going to look at some of the most useful methods that expect us to put a function in.
This section is focused on array methods that expect a callback. 
Arrays come with many built-in methods that accept callback functions.
Now that we've covered callbacks, we can learn these methods. They are super useful! 
The general pattern here is that we are going to run a function once per element in each array. 
each method will have different goals. 
The methods we see here are going to be used all the time.
