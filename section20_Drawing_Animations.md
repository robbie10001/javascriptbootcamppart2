### Welcome to Part 2

In part one of this course, we looked at many different individual topics. We also focused on the basic features of Javascript and we didn't build any large applications.

In this part of the course we are going to be looking at fewer topics but in much more detail. We are going to be focusing on design patterns and more advanced concepts within Javascript. We are going to be building nothing but large apps and we are going to be doing a lot of refactoring of our code.

We are going to get our toolbox of different skills to build our own apps in our own way.

### App Overview

The first project that we are going to build is going to be based fully within the browser. This project will focus mainly on our basic javascript skills, especially, classes and functions. 

We are going to be making a timer application. When a user visits our application within the browser, we're going to show them a number a play button and a pause button. 

Whenever the user clicks on play, we're going to have the time count down every second. The user will be able to pause the countdown at any time by clicking the pause button and resume it again by click the play button.

There are going to be a couple of elements within this project that make it a bit interesting and challenging. 

We're going to have a circle, drawn around the timer element, as the timer counts down, we are going to have the circle revolve. 

Whenver a user clicks on the number that is counting down, it will turn into a text input. This will allow the user to change how long the countdown time will run.
